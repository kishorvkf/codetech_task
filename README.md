PROJECT REVIEW :
The Password Checker project aims to enhance user security by evaluating the strength of passwords and providing instant feedback. This tool helps users create robust passwords, ensuring better protection against unauthorized access.

Features :
Password Strength Evaluation: The password checker evaluates passwords based on various criteria, including length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Real-time Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords, along with suggestions for improvement.
Common Password Blacklist: The checker cross-references passwords against a database of commonly used passwords to discourage weak choices.
User Interface: The tool features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to understand password requirements and feedback.
Security Measures: The password checker includes rate limiting to prevent abuse and integrates CAPTCHA for additional security.

Technical Details :
Technologies Used: The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. The back end is developed with Python using the Flask framework.
Architecture: The application follows a client-server model, where the client-side handles user input and displays feedback, and the server-side processes the password strength evaluation.
Functionality

The password checker validates passwords based on:

Minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 characters)
The inclusion of diverse character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
Avoidance of common passwords (using a blacklist)
Optional advanced checks (e.g., entropy calculation)
User Interface
The user interface is user-friendly and responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices. The real-time feedback mechanism ensures that users can see the impact of their changes immediately.

Testing and Performance :

Testing: The password checker underwent extensive unit and integration testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. Tests included various password scenarios to verify that the checker correctly evaluates strength and provides appropriate feedback.
Performance: The tool performs well under normal usage conditions. Stress testing revealed that it can handle multiple simultaneous requests without significant performance degradation.
Security Considerations
Data Handling: User data is processed securely, with no passwords being stored or logged. The system uses secure communication protocols to protect data in transit.
Vulnerabilities: Regular security audits and updates are planned to address potential vulnerabilities and enhance the tool's robustness.
